25Oct2021. The manuscript was submitted for review for consideration of publication in a journal, Journal of Structrual Engineering.

# Notes

The folder contains MATLAB codes that computes the following values that are the results of seismic downtime assessment of seismically isolated buildings with SCBF designed by RI=2 and TFP-1 based on Conditional Spectra approach (notations are explained in the manuscript):

Loss vulnerability functions
Expected annual loss (EAL)
Expected Loss (=EL) Over Time (=t)

To implement this example code, you need to download the data of results of nonlinear seismic response analysis (i.e., multiple stripe analysis; Jalayer, 2003) from the following link:

Please note that one of the MATLAB file "fn_mle_pc.m" used in this folder was obtained from the data set that is associated with the following journal article: Baker JW. (2015). “Efficient analytical fragility function fitting using dynamic structural analysis.” Earthquake Spectra, 31(1), 579-599.
