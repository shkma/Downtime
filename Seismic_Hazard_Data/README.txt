This folder contains data of seismic hazard curves.

The first column is spectral acceleration (in g) and the second column is mean annual frequency of exceedance.

"SeismicHazardData_0.524sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SCBF.
"SeismicHazardData_2.990sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for non-isolated building with SMF.
"SeismicHazardData_3.660sec.txt" contains seismic hazard curve data for isolated building (lower bound isolator properties).
